# Google Analytics Setup Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Google Analytics has been successfully integrated into your Habit Tracker website. Here's what has been implemented:

### 🔧 **What's Included**

1. **Google Analytics Component** (`src/components/analytics/google-analytics.tsx`)
   - Uses Next.js Script component for optimal loading
   - Automatically loads on all pages
   - Includes proper TypeScript definitions

2. **Analytics Hook** (`src/hooks/use-analytics.ts`)
   - Pre-built functions for tracking habit-related events
   - Easy-to-use interface for custom event tracking
   - Includes common habit tracker events

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Google Analytics ID stored in environment variables
   - Secure and configurable setup

### 📊 **Tracking ID**

Your Google Analytics tracking ID: `G-8X4WBV10N3`

### 🚀 **How It Works**

#### **Automatic Page Tracking**
- All page views are automatically tracked
- No additional code needed for basic analytics

#### **Custom Event Tracking**
Use the `useAnalytics` hook in your components:

```tsx
import { useAnalytics } from '@/hooks/use-analytics';

function MyComponent() {
  const analytics = useAnalytics();
  
  const handleHabitComplete = (habitName: string) => {
    analytics.trackHabitCompleted(habitName, new Date().toISOString());
  };
}
```

#### **Available Tracking Functions**
- `trackHabitCreated(habitName, color)`
- `trackHabitCompleted(habitName, date)`
- `trackHabitUncompleted(habitName, date)`
- `trackHabitDeleted(habitName)`
- `trackStreakAchievement(habitName, streakLength)`
- `trackDataExport()`
- `trackDataImport(success)`
- `trackPageView(pageName)`
- `trackFeatureUsage(feature, action)`

### 🔍 **Testing**

#### **Development Environment**
- Analytics test panel appears in bottom-right corner (development only)
- Shows GA loading status and allows sending test events
- Click "Send Test Event" to verify tracking works

#### **Production Verification**
1. Deploy your website
2. Visit your site
3. Check Google Analytics dashboard (may take 24-48 hours for data to appear)
4. Use Google Analytics Real-Time reports for immediate verification

### 🌐 **Deployment Configuration**

#### **Environment Variables**
Make sure these are set in your production environment:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_TRACKING_ID=G-8X4WBV10N3
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

#### **Vercel Deployment**
If using Vercel:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Add environment variables in the "Environment Variables" section
3. Redeploy your application

#### **Other Platforms**
- Netlify: Add to site settings > Environment variables
- Railway: Add to project variables
- Heroku: Use config vars

### 📈 **What You'll See in Google Analytics**

#### **Automatic Data**
- Page views and sessions
- User demographics and interests
- Device and browser information
- Traffic sources

#### **Custom Events**
- Habit creation and completion
- Streak achievements
- Data export/import usage
- Feature usage patterns

### 🎯 **Recommended Google Analytics Setup**

1. **Goals**: Set up goals for habit completion and streak achievements
2. **Audiences**: Create audiences based on user engagement
3. **Custom Dimensions**: Consider adding custom dimensions for habit categories
4. **Conversion Tracking**: Track key actions like habit creation and long streaks

### 🔒 **Privacy Considerations**

- No personal data is tracked
- All tracking is anonymous
- Users can disable tracking via browser settings
- GDPR compliant (no cookies required for basic analytics)

### 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

#### **Analytics Not Loading**
1. Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_TRACKING_ID` is set correctly
2. Verify the tracking ID format (should start with 'G-')
3. Check browser console for errors

#### **Events Not Tracking**
1. Ensure you're using the `useAnalytics` hook correctly
2. Check that events are being called after user interactions
3. Verify in Google Analytics Real-Time events

#### **Development vs Production**
- Analytics loads in both development and production
- Use the test panel in development to verify functionality
- Production data appears in your Google Analytics dashboard

### 📞 **Support**

If you need help with Google Analytics setup:
1. Check the Google Analytics documentation
2. Use the browser developer tools to debug
3. Test with the built-in analytics test panel
